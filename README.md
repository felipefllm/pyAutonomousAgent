## pyAutonomousAgent

pyAutonomousAgent is an open-source academic tool for modeling autonomous agent behaviors through behavior trees.
The tool is an open-source set of computer routines, which was developed with the aim of being easy to use and learn.
A detailed explanation of this tool can be found in [Medeiros 2024].

In this tool the behavior trees are implemented through the python library py-trees [py-trees 2020]. 

As a study case, the tool provides a simulation scenario with a swarm of autonomous agents.
There are two types of autonomous agents:
- a simplified computational model of a drone with a two-dimensional motion model; and
- a computational model of the Skywalker X8 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).



PyFly-fixed-wing tool [Bohn et al. 2019] was used to simulate the Skywalker X8 UAV inside the pyAutonomousAgent tool. 
PyFly-fixed-wing tool provides computational implementation of a 6 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) aerodynamic model of the Skywalker X8 and its respective Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers.
This aerodynamic model of the Skywalker X8 was proposed and validated in [Gryte et al. 2018].

The tool generates a graphical interface, which is an animated gif, based on the final result of the simulation.
The graphical interface is created through the python library celluloid [celluloi 2018].
An example of this interface can be seen below.
